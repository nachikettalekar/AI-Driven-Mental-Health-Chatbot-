# **AI-Driven Mental Health ChatbotðŸ¤–** (To be completed)

Welcome to the AI-Driven Mental Health Chatbot project! This is an advanced, privacy-focused conversational agent designed to provide mental health support using cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP), sentiment analysis, and machine learning techniques. The chatbot offers real-time mood detection, personalized resource recommendations, and secure data handling to ensure user privacy and trust.


## **Key Features**

1. **Real-Time Mood Detection**:
   - Analyzes user inputs (text/voice) to detect mood and emotional state.
   - Utilizes multimodal fusion with Late Fusion Networks for enhanced accuracy.
   - Processes inputs in real-time using Redis Streams.

2. **Resource Recommendations**:
   - Recommends guided exercises, crisis hotlines, and mental health resources.
   - Powered by a Knowledge Graph (Neo4j) with 500+ curated resources.
   - Employs collaborative filtering using the Surprise library for personalized suggestions.

3. **Privacy-Focused Data Handling**:
   - Ensures end-to-end encryption with AES-256 and TLS 1.3.
   - Implements data anonymization using PySyft for federated learning.
   - Uses OAuth2.0 and JWT tokens for secure authentication.

4. **Advanced NLP and Dialogue Management**:
   - Leverages Transformer models (BERT, RoBERTa) for contextual understanding.
   - Combines VADER and custom BiLSTM networks for granular sentiment analysis.
   - Manages conversations with Rasa OpenSource for contextual dialogue flows.

5. **Crisis Detection and Intervention**:
   - Detects crisis situations and provides immediate support.
   - Integrates with external APIs for emergency services and hotlines.

- Uses OAuth2.0 and JWT tokens for secure user authentication.
- Employs PySyft for federated learning and data anonymization.

### **3. Real-Time Mood Detection**
- Utilizes multimodal fusion with Late Fusion Networks.
- Processes inputs in real-time using Redis Streams.

### **4. Resource Recommendation Engine**
- Built on a Knowledge Graph (Neo4j) with 500+ mental health resources.
- Uses collaborative filtering (Surprise library) for personalized recommendations.

### **5. Modern Deployment Stack**
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Docker and Kubernetes for scalable deployment.
- **MLOps**: MLflow and Kubeflow Pipelines for model management.
- **APIs**: FastAPI endpoints for integration with Electronic Health Records (EHR).
